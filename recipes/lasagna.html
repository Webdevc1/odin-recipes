        <p>
            Butternut squash and garlic are the stars of this rich and creamy lasagna loved by carnivores and vegetarians. A dear aunt gave me this roasted butternut squash and garlic lasagna recipe.
            I have made it many times. It is easy to make parts of it in advance to save time.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds butternut squash, halved and seeded</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 quart milk</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>9 no-cook lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Brush butternut squash halves with vegetable oil and season with salt.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until golden and easily pierced with a knife, 45 to 50 minutes.
                Cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then scoop flesh into a bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot butter until softened. 
                Stir in flour and cook for 3 minutes. Whisk in milk until smooth. 
                Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally until thickened, about 10 minutes.
                Stir in butternut squash flesh and season with salt and pepper.
                Butternut sauce can be made 3 days ahead and refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Beat heavy cream in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until foamy. 
                Gradually season with salt, continuing to beat until medium peaks form.
                Lift the beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak should curl over slightly. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 cup butternut sauce into the prepared baking dish and place 3 lasagna noodles on top in a single layer.
                Spread 1/2 of remaining sauce over noodles and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with another layer of noodles, spread remaining sauce on top, and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Place final layer of noodles on top. Spread whipped cream over noodles, making sure pasta is completely covered. 
                Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>
                Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is bubbly and golden brown, about 10 minutes. 
                Allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
